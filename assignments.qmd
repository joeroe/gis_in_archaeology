Both assignments should be handed in electronically on or before **19 February 2023**.
Please contact the course instructor if you want an extension for any reason.

## Practical portfolio

Your practical portfolio is a summary of the work you did through the practical sessions.
It is intended to evaluate your **knowledge and understanding** of the course content.

### Format

Please submit a single file (this can be an archive, e.g. `.zip`) containing your portfolio.
It should include all the maps and other outputs you were asked to include in the practical sessions, as well as answers to the questions (marked **Q:**).
Please ensure that it is clear which parts belong to which session.
You are welcome to include additional relevent material, but this will not contribute to your grade.

### Assessment

Each element of your portfolio will be assessed on the basis of whether it shows a satisfactory knowledge and understanding of the material presented in that session.
Your grade will be calculated from the proportion of elements assessed as satisfactory, and will constitute 50% of the course grade.
Written feedback will be provided on any elements that were assessed as unsatisfactory.

## Individual project

Your individual project is intended to assess your ability to **communicate and apply** the skills you have acquired during the course.
