title: "Course review & assignment workshop"
---

In our final session we will review what you have learned on the course and prepare for your [final assignments](assignments.qmd).

## Prerequisites

Please prepare a short presentation (c. 5 minutes) of what you intend to map for the individual project component of your assignment.
Consider:

1. What 'archaeological phenomenon' will I map?
2. Where will I get the data I need?
3. What form of spatial analysis will I apply?

None of this is binding at this stage â€“ but the more you can flesh out your ideas, the more helpful the feedback will be!

## Workshop

1. Presentations of individual projects
    * Instructor & peer feedback
    * Discussion of anticipated challenges
2. Open questions about any outstanding elements of the practical portfolio
3. Open questions about the assignment format, deadlines, etc.
