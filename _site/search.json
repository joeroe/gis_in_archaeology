    "text": "GIS in Archaeology – fall semester, 2022 (HS2022)\nThis course provides a basic introduction to the archaeological use of GIS, to the techniques for collecting, managing and visualising spatial data, and to the most commonly used analysis tools. Participants will learn how to utilise the currently most widely used open-source GIS system (QGIS).\nStudents will acquire the skills required for a complete GIS workflow from data acquisition to analysis and cartographic output. Everywhere there is a strong interest in how such techniques can be used to solve major archaeological problems. This course would be of particular benefit to those who wish to be introduced to GIS to facilitate their research and/or as a basis for more advanced techniques such as spatial statistics, network analysis and computer-aided analysis of human history. The course will be held in a combination of lectures, practical exercises and tutorials in the computer room of the institute. It will be evaluated through practical components and a (theoretical/practical) exam.\nThe course will be taught in English."

In addition to a web browser, we will be using the free R software and the desktop version of the R Studio integrated development environment (IDE). We will also be using various packages not contained in the base installation of R, but we will wait and install them at the necessary time. The instructor will be available during the first week of class to help students troubleshoot any software installation problems.\nStudents will also be required to have a user account on GitHub, which we will be using for file hosting and communications via “issues”. If you do not already have an account, you can sign up for a free one here. The instructor will provide training on how to use the intended features in GitHub."
