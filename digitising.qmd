title: "Georeferencing & digitising"
---

Much valuable geospatial data remains in analogue format, e.g. printed maps or lists of coordinates.
This session will cover the processes of georeferencing (assigning explicit geographic coordinates to scanned images) and digitising (creating vector geospatial layers from images and other reference material).
