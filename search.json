In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment, we ask the following:\n\nPlease let us know if you have a name or set of preferred pronouns that you would like us to use\nPlease let us know if anyone in class says something that makes you feel uncomfortable\n\nIf an instructor should be the one to say or do something that makes a student uncomfortable, you should feel free to contact the Director of the Prehistoric Archaeology of Bern University.\n\nIf you believe you have been a victim of any form of discrimination, you have the right to report it to the University.\n\nIn addition, we encourage the following kinds of behaviors:\n\nUse welcoming and inclusive language\nShow courtesy and respect towards others\nAcknowledge different viewpoints and experiences\nGracefully accept constructive criticism\n\nAlthough we strive to create and use inclusive materials in this course, there may be overt or covert biases in the course material due to the lens with which it was written.

If you feel like your performance in class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please talk with us.\n\nDisabilities\nIf you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to us at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (e.g., mental health, learning, vision, hearing, physical impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or via email or their website. DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, your instructor(s) and DRS.\n\n\nReligious observances\nStudents who expect to miss class or assignments as a consequence of their religious observance will be provided with a reasonable accommodation to fulfill their academic responsibilities. Absence from class for religious reasons does not relieve students from responsibility for the course work required during the period of absence. It is the responsibility of the student to provide the instructor with advance notice of the dates of religious holidays on which they will be absent. Students who are absent will be offered an opportunity to make up the work, without penalty, within a reasonable time, as long as the student has made prior arrangements."

Participants will learn how to utilise the currently most widely used open-source GIS system (QGIS).\nStudents will acquire the skills required for a complete GIS workflow from data acquisition to analysis and cartographic output. Everywhere there is a strong interest in how such techniques can be used to solve major archaeological problems. This course would be of particular benefit to those who wish to be introduced to GIS to facilitate their research and/or as a basis for more advanced techniques such as spatial statistics, network analysis and computer-aided analysis of human history. The course will be held in a combination of lectures, practical exercises and tutorials in the computer room of the institute. It will be evaluated through practical components and a (theoretical/practical) exam.\nThe course will be taught in English."
