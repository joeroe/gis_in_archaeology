If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (e.g., mental health, learning, vision, hearing, physical impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or via email or their website.

Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, your instructor(s) and DRS.\n\n\nReligious observances\nStudents who expect to miss class or assignments as a consequence of their religious observance will be provided with a reasonable accommodation to fulfill their academic responsibilities. Absence from class for religious reasons does not relieve students from responsibility for the course work required during the period of absence. It is the responsibility of the student to provide the instructor with advance notice of the dates of religious holidays on which they will be absent. Students who are absent will be offered an opportunity to make up the work, without penalty, within a reasonable time, as long as the student has made prior arrangements."

Participants will learn how to utilise the currently most widely used open-source GIS system (QGIS).\nStudents will acquire the skills required for a complete GIS workflow from data acquisition to analysis and cartographic output. Everywhere there is a strong interest in how such techniques can be used to solve major archaeological problems. This course would be of particular benefit to those who wish to be introduced to GIS to facilitate their research and/or as a basis for more advanced techniques such as spatial statistics, network analysis and computer-aided analysis of human history. The course will be held in a combination of lectures, practical exercises and tutorials in the computer room of the institute. It will be evaluated through practical components and a (theoretical/practical) exam.\nThe course will be taught in English."

This is one of two broad types of cartographic representations (the other being terrain maps), encompassing any map where the main object is to communicate how a given property (the ‘theme’) varies in space, with the actual shape of the Earth being a secondary aspect (if present at all). Some common examples of thematic maps in archaeology are distribution maps (especially of sites) or density (choropleth) maps of finds. We will focus especially on point distribution maps, one of the most simple but effective genres of cartography in archaeology."

Why might doing it by hand become inefficient?\n\nIn the layer panel, export the selected features as a new layer, then add it to your map.\nUsing single symbol symbology, adjust the appearance of the two country layers to highlight those containing Acheulean sites.\nUsing inverted symbology, adjust the appearance of the two country layers to highlight those containing Acheulean sites.\n\nQ: What other uses might inverted symbology have?\n\n\nSave an image of a map using your preferred symbology for your portfolio.\n\n\nThematic mapping with lines\nFinally, let’s explore how we can use data to vary the appearance of lines.\n\nIf you haven’t already, download a river layer from Natural Earth Data and add it to your map.\nAdjust the symbology of the river layer appropriately.\nUse a data variable to adjust the width of the river layer.
