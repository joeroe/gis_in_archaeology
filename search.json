Participants will learn how to utilise the currently most widely used open-source GIS system (QGIS).\nStudents will acquire the skills required for a complete GIS workflow from data acquisition to analysis and cartographic output. Everywhere there is a strong interest in how such techniques can be used to solve major archaeological problems. This course would be of particular benefit to those who wish to be introduced to GIS to facilitate their research and/or as a basis for more advanced techniques such as spatial statistics, network analysis and computer-aided analysis of human history. The course will be held in a combination of lectures, practical exercises and tutorials in the computer room of the institute. It will be evaluated through practical components and a (theoretical/practical) exam.\nThe course will be taught in English."

Like most GIS and statistical software, QGIS does not work with a single file. It uses ‘projects’ (.qgz files or .qgs in older versions) to separate different working environments, which may incorporate many different files containing geospatial data, layer and style definitions, and output in various formats. QGIS does not impose a structure on these files: it is up to you to keep them organised.\nThere isn’t a single way to organise files. Above all, the most important thing is that your file structure is consistent and predictable – to you and to others.\n\nStart a new project in QGIS and save it in a new directory\n\nUnder Project → Properties, in the General tab, ensure that save paths is set to ‘relative’ (this is the default)\nQ: What is the difference between ‘relative’ and ‘absolute’ file paths?\n\nCreate a basic directory structure for your project. Bear in mind it will include:\n\nData files, project files, and output files (e.g. maps)\nBase map data\nData from different regions\nData in different file formats\nNB.: You don’t have to leave QGIS to do this. Look for the ‘Project Home’ node in the browser pane.\n\nCopy acheulean.csv to an appropriate place within your project and add it your map.\nSave your project, close QGIS, move or rename your project directory, then open it in QGIS again.\nChange save paths to ‘absolute’ and repeat the last step.\n\nQ: What happened?\n\nSet save paths back to the default, ‘relative’.\n\nQ: Why is it better to use relative paths?\n\n\nUse this project to organise all the data you will work with over the course of this practical. In your portfolio, include your finished file structure, after you have completed the rest of the practical.\n\n\nData sources\nThere are a lot of file formats that can be used as data sources within a GIS. From a GIS user’s point of view, we can group them into three categories: delimited text files, file- or directory-based formats, and database-based formats.\n\nDelimited text files\nPlain text files are the most common and portable way to store tabular data (‘spreadsheets’) in a scientific context. The are not a true geospatial format, because they do not contain information on the coordinate reference system, but they are widely used to distribute geospatial data, especially point geometries.\n\nCopy acheulean.csv, acheulean.tsv, acheulean.txt and acheulean_utm36s.csv to your project.\nAdd all four files to your map\n\nEnsure that they are all imported correctly, i.e. they should result in exactly the same points with exactly the same attributes being added to your map.\nQ: When might you prefer delimited text files over geospatial formats?\n\n\n\n\nFile/directory-based geospatial formats\nThe majority of commonly used formats fall into this category, where geospatial data (geometries, attributes, and CRS) is bundled together in either a single file, or a collection of files contained within a single directory. Adding any of these formats to a project in QGIS is generally straightforward, as is converting between them, so the choice is not so relevent in day-to-day work. However, it is important to consider which format is the best for long-term storage and exchange.\n\nFill in the table below for your portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat\nFile extension\nVector or raster?\nOpen format?\n\n\n\n\nShapefile\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoJSON\n\n\n\n\n\nKML\n\n\n\n\n\nAutocad DXF\n\n\n\n\n\nGeopackage\n\n\n\n\n\nFlatGeobuf\n\n\n\n\n\nGPX\n\n\n\n\n\nGeodatabase\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoTIFF\n\n\n\n\n\nASCII Grid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy fundstellen_bern.csv to your project and add it to your map.\nExport fundstellen_bern.csv to each of the formats below, copying the exported file to your project:\n\nESRI shapefile\nGeoPackage\nComma Seperated Value (CSV)\nQ: What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of these formats?\n\n\n\n\nDatabase-based geospatial formats\nWhen geospatial data gets more complex, it is common to incorporate them within a relational database system (RDMS). Some of the file-based formats above (e.g. GeoPackage, Geodatabase) are in fact databases saved as a file (or files). Most general-purpose database software (e.g. MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite) also have extensions for representing geospatial data – usually in the form of a special “geometry” column. The latter can be used to connect to data sources in a remote location. Otherwise, they work much like any other format.\n\n\n\nAttribute data\nApart from the geospatial data needed to put points (or lines, or polygons) on a map, geospatial formats usually come with “attributes”; that is, a table of data associated with the geometries. This is what we have been using for data-dependent symbologies, for example. QGIS has many features for selecting, filtering and manipulating these attributes.\n\nCopy c14_dates.csv to your project.\nConvert it to a suitable geospatial format, add this to your map, and remove the CSV.\nView the attribute table of the layer.\n\nQ: What data types are used in this attribute table?\n\nUsing select features by value, export dates from the ‘radon’ and ‘radonb’ databases as a new layer and add it to your project.\nUsing the filter tool, filter this layer to only show dates which fit the following conditions:\n\nHave an error (std) of less than 50\nAre from samples of charcoal, “collagen, bone” or “plant remains”\nAre from the Bronze Age\nQ: How many dates fit all these criteria?\n\nEdit the attribute table to correct the lab codes from ‘Rome-’. They should be ‘R-’.\nUsing the field calculator, update the ‘site_type’ field to use uppercase letters.\nUsing the field calculator, create a new column with the difference between the uncalibrated and calibrated ages.\n\nRemember to include your finished file structure from the first part of this practical in your portfolio."

There are a few strategies we can use, though it can be tricky to overcome completely. Often you will have to settle for getting labels ‘as good as possible’ in QGIS, and manually adjust them later in other software. Try to:\n\nAdjust the placement and rendering of labels in your layer\n\nQ: What rendering options are there for reducing duplication of labels in different types of layer?\n\nUse the Export selected features… tool to reduce the number of features on the screen and/or selectively label them\n\nQ: What factors might influence your choice of whether to show e.g. cities?\n\nUse buffer, mask or shadow formatting to increase the visibility of labels against features\n\nExport an image of your map, with overplotting reduced as much as possible, for your portfolio.\n\n\nComposing a print layout\nUntil now we have worked with maps as they appear within QGIS, exporting them as images ‘on the fly’. In practice, publication-quality maps require additional elements (annotations, etc.) and should be exported at a specific print size – even if only ‘printed’ digitally (e.g. to a PDF). In QGIS, these are handled in the map composer.\n\nUse Project → New print layout… to create a new print layout and open the map composer\nUnder page properties, change the page size to A5 landscape\n\nQ: In practice, what would determine how big your printed map should be?\n\nAdd map to the page, making it fill the full page, and use the move item content tool to adjust the position and scale\n\nQ: You can have more than one map on a page: when might this be useful?\n\nExport your map as an image and as a PDF\n\nQ: What is the difference between\n\nGo back to the main QGIS window and adjust the font size of the feature labels until they look good on the printed layout\n\nQ: Why does the text look different in QGIS, compared to the exported page?\n\n\nInclude your map, exported as an image, in your portfolio.\n\n\nAnnotating a print layout\n\nAdd a north arrow to your map\n\nQ: When is a north arrow helpful?\n\nAdd a text annotation (e.g. its author’s name) to your map\nAdd a dynamic text annotation (e.g. the date) to your map\n\nExport your annotated map for your portfolio.\n\n\nScales, grids, and legends\n\nFix your print layout to a numeric scale, e.g. 20000000.\nEnsuring that you have set the project CRS appropriately, add a scale bar in kilometers to your map\nAdd a grid in latitude/longitude degrees to your map\n\nQ: What information does a grid give the reader of the map, that a scale bar doesn’t?\n\nAdjust the styling of the scale bar and grid.\nRemove the labels from the sites layer and instead use categorised symbology to give each site a different colour and symbol.\nAdd a legend to your print layout and style it accordingly.\n\nQ: Why use a legend instead of labelling features directly?\n\n\nExport your annotated map for your portfolio."
