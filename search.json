There are a few strategies we can use, though it can be tricky to overcome completely. Often you will have to settle for getting labels ‘as good as possible’ in QGIS, and manually adjust them later in other software. Try to:\n\nAdjust the placement and rendering of labels in your layer\n\nQ: What rendering options are there for reducing duplication of labels in different types of layer?\n\nUse the Export selected features… tool to reduce the number of features on the screen and/or selectively label them\n\nQ: What factors might influence your choice of whether to show e.g. cities?\n\nUse buffer, mask or shadow formatting to increase the visibility of labels against features\n\nExport an image of your map, with overplotting reduced as much as possible, for your portfolio.\n\n\nComposing a print layout\nUntil now we have worked with maps as they appear within QGIS, exporting them as images ‘on the fly’. In practice, publication-quality maps require additional elements (annotations, etc.) and should be exported at a specific print size – even if only ‘printed’ digitally (e.g. to a PDF).

It involves two stages: first defining control points (points on the map with known locations) and then defining the transformation used to fit the source map to the desired coordinate reference system. There are in turn two basic ways to define control points: by using known coordinates (e.g. from a grid, landmark, or cross-referencing with a table) or by matching features with another, already digitised, map of the same area. We will try both in this practical.\n\nAdd the map images to your Islay project and open it in QGIS.\nChange the Project CRS to OSGB36 / British National Grid (EPSG:27700)\n\nThis is the projection used in the two Islay maps.\n\nOpen the Georeferencer (Layer → Georeferencer)\nUse the Open Raster... button to add islay_sites.jpg to the Georeferencer.\n\nLuckily, this map has some grid references included in the frame of the map. These reference the British National Grid and are in the format NRXXYY, where ‘NR’ is a map sheet and XX and YY are the easting and northing coordinates in kilometres. We can look up the geographic coordinates of the corners of these grid squares, for example at https://britishnationalgrid.uk/. It’s not explicitly stated, but let’s assume that the origin (lower left corner) of the map is at grid reference NR1540.\n\nIn a browser, open https://britishnationalgrid.uk/ and navigate to Islay\nUnder ‘grid reference’, change ‘six-figure’ to ‘four-figure’.\nBack in the Georeferencer, select the Add Point tool and click on one of the corners of the grid squares. Then input its X and Y coordinates.\n\nRefer back to the website from steps 5–6 to find these coordinates.\n\nRepeat step 7 until you have at least three control points.\n\nQ: What is the advantage of picking more than three points?\n\nOpen the Transformation Settings window and tick ‘create world file only’\n\nThis means the image will not be ‘warped’, just have coordinates attached to it. We can do this because the source and target CRSes are the same (British National Grid).\n\nClick Start Georeferencing. If all goes well, you should now see a georeferenced version of the map in the main QGIS window.\n\nNow we will georeference the maps of the Islay coastline. Unfortunately these don’t have grid references, but since they’re of the same place, we can piggy-back off the work we’ve already done.\n\nAs before, load one of the coastline maps into the Georeferencer.\n\nWhen asked, you do not need to save the control points from the previous steps.\n\nPick a place on the coastline and add a control point, but this time, instead of entering coordinates, click the From Map Canvas button and click on the corresponding point on the map you have just georeferenced.\nRepeat step 12 until you have at least three coordinates.\nRepeat steps 9–10 and inspect the georeferenced map.\n\nIf it doesn’t fit well to the other maps, you may have to add or remove control points.\nGenerally you need more control points to get an accurate result when georeferencing this way – three is rarely sufficient.\n\nRepeat steps 11–14 for the remaining coastline maps.\n\nExport quick maps of your georeferenced images for your portfolio.\n\n\nDigitising\nNow we have the image georeferenced and displayed in QGIS like other layers, but if we are going to make full use of them, we need to turn them into vector data.\n\nCreate a new geopackage layer that we will use for the site data (Layer → Create Layer)\n\nPick a sensible database filename and table name; they can be the same.\nThe ‘geometry type’ should be ‘point’\nThe CRS should be OSGB36 / British National Grid (EPSG:27700)\nAdd a field to contain the period assigned to the site; pick a sensible name and use ‘Text (string)’ type\n\nEdit your new layer and use the Add Point Feature tool to create a point for each site.\n\nYou will be asked to fill in the period field you created; do so.\nRemember to save the edits to your layer often and, when you are finished,\n\nCreate a new geopackage layer that we will use for the coast data (Layer → Create Layer)\n\nPick a sensible database filename and table name; you can save all four layers in the same geopackage database if you wish.\nThe ‘geometry type’ should be ‘polygon’\nThe CRS should be OSGB36 / British National Grid (EPSG:27700)\n\nDigitise the coastline maps using the Add Polygon Feature tools.\n\nFor the lakes, you will need to turn on the advanced digitising toolbar and use the ‘add ring’ tool.\nThe coastline is the same across many images, so you can save time by copying polygons between layers and using the reshape features tool to change them.\nOn the 13000 BP map, make a seperate polygon for the ice sheet.\n\n\nExport quick maps of your digitised layers for your portfolio."

    "section": "Areal statistics",
    "text": "Areal statistics\nOne very simply way of aggregating point data into an area is to simply count the number of points in the area. This assumes that we know the area we are interested in advance. Let’s suppose we were interested in how many sites were found in the coastal (<50 m a.s.l.), lowland (50–100 m a.s.l.) and highland (100+ m a.s.l.) zones of Islay.\n\nFirst we need to generate polygons for the elevation zones we are interested. We will do this using nasadem_islay – make sure you have this in your project.\nUse Raster → Extraction → Contour to generate contours from nasadem_islay.\n\nSet the ‘Interval’ to 50.\nUnder ‘advanced parameters’, set ‘additional command-line parameters’ to -p. This generates polygons instead of lines (the default).\n\nThe resulting layer is not labelled by elevation zone, so add a field with this now.\n\nThis is easier if you first merge all the polygons over 100 m a.s.l. into one.\n\nUse the Count Points in Polygon tool (under Vector → Analysis) to count the number of points in each area.\nUse the attribute table to inspect the result, then adjust the symbology of the layer to show it visually.\n\nQ: What does this tell us about site location patterns on Islay?\n\nLet’s calculate the density of sites in each area also. Using the field calculator (accessed via the attribute table), create a new field to calculate the number of sites per m^2.\n\nEnsure the ‘output field type’ is set to Decimal number (real)\nUse the expression \"NUMPOINTS\" / $area, adjusting \"NUMPOINTS\" if you named the field containing the site counts something different.\nQ: Why is density more informative than an absolute count here?\n\n\nInclude a map showing site density by elevation zone in your portfolio.\n\nKernel Density Estimation (‘heatmaps’)\nKernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a method for calculating the density of points across a space. More formally, it assumes that these points are manifestations of a continuous density function across that space, and attempts to estimate this underlying ‘hidden field’ by moving a regular-sized window (the ‘kernel’) over it and counting the points within it. In more practical terms, the resulting ‘heatmaps’ show where there are more things and where there are less things, in a way that is easier to take in at a glance than a cloud of points. They are very useful both as a visualisation and analysis tool, especially when you’re dealing with a lof points.\nOne major caveat is that KDE is highly sensitive to the choice of kernel radius. There are several algorithms for choosing a kernel radius more objectively – but unfortunately none of them are implemented in QGIS! We must therefore bear in mind that generating heatmaps in QGIS is first and foremost a visualisation and exploratory tool. For more rigorous density analyses, it is probably better to switch to something like R.\n\nOpen the processing toolbox and find the heatmap tool, under ‘interpolation’.\nSelect islay_sites as the point layer. Leave the other options blank and click run.\nInspect the resulting map. Does it tell us anything meaningful about the density of sites? Repeat step 2, varying the value of radius, until you find something you are happy with.\n\nQ: How does the choice of radius affect the resulting heatmap?\n\nGenerate three more heatmaps, one for each of the period categories in this dataset.\n\nYou can do this by generating new layers, or using the ‘Selected features only’ option of the Heatmap tool\nUse the same radius for each\nQ: Can we see any differences in site densities between periods?\n\n\nInclude the three heatmaps generated in step 4 in your portfolio.\n\n\nInterpolation\nWhat if we are not interested just in where points are, but some quality about them? Interpolation is the process of taking a nominal (i.e. a description) or continuous variable (i.e. a number) recorded in specific locations and using this to estimate its value across a whole space. There are many techniques for doing this. We will look at three of the most common: Thiessen polygons (better known as Voronoi polygons outside of archaeology), Nearest Neighbour interpolation, and Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation. Notably, we will not look at kriging (because it is not natively implemented in QGIS), though this is also amongst the most common.\n\nThiessen polygons\nThiessen polygons simply consider each place on the map as ‘belonging’ the point closest to it. They are what you get if you draw lines exactly in the middle of each pair of points, then join them up into polygons. They can be used to roughly interpolate nominal or continuous data.\n\nGenerate Thiessen polygons for islay_sites using the Voronoi polygons tool.\n\nVary the value of ‘buffer %’ until the resulting polygons cover the entire island.\n\nClip the resulting polygons to the island of Islay.\nAlter the symbology to colour the polygons by period.\n\nQ: Why aren’t Thiessen polygons very informative for Islay?\n\n\nInclude a map of your Thiessen polygons in your portfolio.\n\n\nNearest Neighbour\nNearest Neighbour (NN) is the simplest form of raster-based interpolation. Essentially it is the Thiessen polygons, transferred onto a raster – which is in fact how you calculate it in QGIS (other software provides dedicated raster NN tools). It can be used for nominal or continuous data.\n\nUse the Rasterize tool (Raster → Conversion) to convert your Thiessen polygons to a raster.\n\nSince rasters can only contain numeric data, you will need to create a new field that encodes the period as a number (e.g. Mesolithic→1, Mesolithic & Later Prehistoric→2, …)\nSelect the numeric-period field as the ‘Field to use for a burn-in value’.\nChoose a sensible output raster size (e.g. 1000x1000).\n\nRepeat step 1 with a field containing the number of artefacts.\n\nYou will need to download islay_sites.gpkg for this – your version does not have the artefact counts!\n\n\nInclude maps of your nearest neighbour interpolations in your portfolio.\n\n\nIDW\nInverse distance weighted (IDW) is a more sophisticated method appropriate for continuous data. It also produces a raster, but varies the output value according to the distance to the nearest point.\n\nUse the IDW Interpolation tool (in the Processing Toolbox) on the islay_sites data.\n\nSelect artefact count as the ‘Interpolation attribute’\nSelect the study area (island of Islay) as the extent.\nChoose a sensible output raster size (e.g. 1000x1000).\n\nRepeat step 1 separately for each period.\n\nQ: Compare the result of this map to the density analysis above. What extra information does it provide?\n\n\nInclude maps of your IDW interpolations in your portfolio."

    "text": "Practical\n\nData\nFrom previous practicals:\n\nA DEM of Islay\n\nThis can be a modern DEM, or one you have modelled for a past time period.\ne.g. nasadem_islay_7000bp.tif\n\nislay_sites.gpkg – Mesolithic and Later Prehistoric sites on Islay\n\n\n\nCalculating a cost surface\nThe first step in any movement analysis is to calculate a cost surface – a raster describing how much it would ‘cost’ to move through each cell of a landscape. Cost surfaces are calculated using a ‘cost function’. There are many cost functions to choose from and a large literature on how this effects subsequent movement modelling. The majority, but not all, derive the cost of movement from surface slope calculated from a DEM, under the basic assumption that people prefer to walk on flat ground. We will opt for one of the simplest, the ‘ox-cart function’:\n\\(1 + (s/c)^2\\)\nWhere \\(s\\) is the slope percentage and \\(c\\) is a ‘critical slope’ value beyond which moving is heavily penalised (we will use 10 for this).\n\nLoad or prepare a suitable DEM raster for Islay\n\nIt must use a projected coordinate system, e.g. EPSG:27700\nThe sea must be marked as ‘NoData’ (i.e. it should not be visible when you view the raster in QGIS). If necessary you can do this using the Clip Raster by Mask Layer… tool (Raster → Extraction), using a ocean/coast vector as your mask layer and assigning the ‘NoData’ value -32768 (the lowest possible 16-bit integer).\n\nCalculate the percentage slope for this DEM using the Slope tool (Raster → Analysis)\n\nEnsure ‘Slope expressed as percent instead of degrees’ is ticked.\nQ: Our subsequent models will be based solely on slope. Is this a good representation of human movement? What other factors could be important?\n\nUse the Raster Calculator to calculate a cost surface using the ox-cart function.\n\nYour expression should be something like 1 + (\"slope@1\"/10)^2 (replacing slope with the name of your layer)\nYou will probably need to adjust the ‘Min’ and ‘Max’ values in the symbology to display it in a meaningful way\nQ: What has happened to the ‘NoData’ areas (i.e. the sea)? What effect will this have on models of movement on this surface?\n\n\nInclude a quick map showing your cost surface in your portfolio.\n\n\nModelling least-cost paths\nA least-cost path is the optimal route between two points considering a given cost surface. This could represent any number of things—a route taken, a road, a river—depending on the cost surface.\nQGIS doesn’t support least-cost path analysis natively, but it can through plugins and extensions. For more complex analyses, GRASS and SAGA—two other open source GIS which can, if installed, be used throught QGIS—offer the fullest features. But the ‘Least-Cost Path’ plugin for QGIS offers a quick and simple way to calculate the least-cost path between a start point and end point(s), so we’ll start with that.\n\n\nInstall the Least-Cost Path plugin in QGIS.\nThe Least-Cost Path plugin cannot handle layers with negative values in. Use the raster calculator to remove any negative values from your cost surface raster.\n\nYou can use the expression MAX ( 0, \"oxcost@1\" ) to set them to zero.\nBecause these cells are marked as NoData, this won’t actually have an effect on the analysis (yet).\n\nReproject islay_sites to the same CRS as your DEM/cost surface rasters.\nDuplicate this reprojeced layer, ensuring that the two versions have different names.\n\nWe will use this to manage start and end points.\n\nSelect one site in the start layer and one or more site in the end layer.\nUse the Least Cost Path tool in the processing toolbox to calculate the least-cost path between two sites.\n\nSet ‘cost raster layer’ to your cost surface.\nSet ‘cost raster band’ to the only available option (Band1).\nChoose the start and end point vector layers you prepared – ensuring the CRSs match.\nEnsure ‘selected features only’ is checked.\n\nRepeat steps 7–9 with a few other sets of sites.\n\nQ: What does this tell us about how topography might have affected prehistoric movement across Islay? Include a map of calculated least-cost paths in your portfolio.\n\nUse the Fill NoData cells tool in the processing toolbox (not ‘Fill nodata’) to replace the sea in your cost surface with a) zero and b) a very high number (e.g. 999).\n\nThese represent ‘easy seafaring’ and ‘hard seafaring’ scenarios respectively.\n\nRepeat steps 7–9 a few times for each ‘seafaring’ scenario.\n\nQ: Which do you think is more realistic?\n\n\nInclude a map of calculated least-cost paths for the two scenarios in your portfolio."

This is one of two broad types of cartographic representations (the other being terrain maps), encompassing any map where the main object is to communicate how a given property (the ‘theme’) varies in space, with the actual shape of the Earth being a secondary aspect (if present at all). Some common examples of thematic maps in archaeology are distribution maps (especially of sites) or density (choropleth) maps of finds. We will focus especially on point distribution maps, one of the most simple but effective genres of cartography in archaeology."

    "text": "Practical\nFirst, some caveats.\nIt is impossible for us to cover the full range of geospatial data sources used in archaeology, since this depends greatly on the particular region and application. For this practical, we will focus on sources of data that cover the whole globe, as the ‘common denominator’, but it is important to bear in mind that these may not be the ‘best’ data sources for a given problem. For Europe especially, archaeologists often work primarily, or exclusively, with national data provided by government agencies. These are usually more varied and detailed than datasets covering the whole globe. Geospatial data published by the Swiss federal government, for example, are catalogued in the ‘INSPIRE’ portal. But for many other parts of the world, or in analyses that span multiple countries, there are some common sources of data.\nSimilarly, we focus here on open, publicly available datasets, for reasons of both practicality and scientific transparency. More detailed and high quality commerical datasets are available are available. For example, many companies sell satellite imagery at sub-metre resolution, whereas the best available public imagery is 10 m. Here we must be careful of the ‘Google Earth effect’: we’re all accustomed to seeing very high resolution, high quality imagery in off-the-shelf (and usually free) software, so we might expect to be able to use it for our own purposes. But this is because the companies that make these applications have licensed commercial imagery. Generally speaking, the raw versions of these images are not available publicly, and you would not be able to use them in a publication, for example, without obtaining a license to do so yourself.\n\nPreparation\nWe’ll be assembling data for a project on the island of Islay (pronounced Ai-luh), part of the Hebrides archipelago off the west coast of Scotland. The prehistoric landscape of Islay was comprehensively documented by the ‘Southern Hebrides Mesolithic Project’ (1988–98, see Mithen 2000), which included several pioneering applications of GIS in archaeology.\nBefore you start collecting data, it’s a good idea to define precisely what your region of interest is. You will use this narrow down your search queries and to limit the amount of files you have to download. It’s worth spending a bit of time defining a region here – it’s a pain to find out afterwards that you didn’t get everything you needed! Tools like Google Earth—which, as mentioned above, is first and foremost a browser for previewing geospatial data, rather than a source of it—can come in handy here, since we don’t yet have any data to base this on.\n\nCreate a new project for Islay, with an appropriate directory structure. Use this for all the data you obtain in this practical.\nOpen Google Earth and navigate to Islay\nUsing the add polygon tool, define a rectangular study region by drawing four corners around Islay, leaving plenty of space around the island.\n\nQ: Why is it useful to have a rectangular study region? Why not use the boundaries of the island exactly?\n\nExport the polygon from Google Earth as a KML file then, in QGIS, convert it to a shapefile and add it to your project.\nIn QGIS, under View -> Panels, enable the vertex editor panel. Then, select the layer with your rectangular region, turn on editing mode, and select the vertex tool. Right click on the study region polygon to display its exact coordinates in the vertex editor.\nIn the vertex editor, adjust the corners of your study region so that it is an exact rectangle.\n\nIt’s usually helpful to choose ‘round’ coordinates for the study region boundaries, since you will sometimes have to enter them by hand.\n\nSave your edits the layer. This will be your broad study region.\nUsing ‘land’ data from Natural Earth, create a layer containing just the island of Islay itself, and add this to your project.\nMake a quick map showing your study region, with appropriate base layers, and export it for your portfolio.\n\nNatural Earth island region.\n\n\nVector topographic data\nBy now you’re already very familiar with Natural Earth as a source of free, public domain base map data, but for this project we are also going to need more detailed data.\n\nObtain GSHHG data for the coastline.\n\nQ: GSHHG contains many different layers. We want the highest resolution layer showing the coastline Islay: which one is it?\nOnly include one coastline layer in your project.\n\nObtain HydroSHEDS data for rivers.\nMake a quick map showing the detailed coastline and rivers on Islay, and export it for your portfolio.\n\n\n\nDEMs\nDEMs are the basis of many types of geospatial analysis and visualisations, and there are many available. OpenTopography is a helpful resource for locating the best DEM for a given area. At the moment, the best ‘all rounder’ is NASADEM, available at 1 arc second resolution for the whole globe. It is a refinement of the SRTM DEM we have used in previous practicals produced by NASA. We will also obtain a lower resolution (90m) SRTM layer that includes bathymetry.\n\nUsing OpenTopography, obtain NASADEM digital elevation data for the study region.\nUsing OpenTopography, obtain SRTM ‘Global Bathymetry and Topography’ data for the study region.\nBack in QGIS, use the merge raster tool to combine the seperate ‘tiles’ you have downloaded into a single file for each DEM.\n\nRemember to name the merged file something sensible!\n\nUse the clip raster by extent tool to limit the DEM to just the study region.\nMake a quick map showing the bathymetry (SRTM) and topography (NASADEM) around Islay, and export it for your portfolio.\n\n\n\nSatellite imagery\nLike DEMs, there are many sources of satellite imagery. Sentinel-2 imagery is a good all-round option with global coverage; it can be accessed through the Copernicus Open Access Hub. We might also be interested in historic imagery. For this Landsat is a good option, since the Landsat programme has been running continuously since 1972; it can be obtained from the USGS EarthExplorer portal. You will need to register an account to use both.\n\nObtain Sentinel 2 (S2A) imagery for Islay from Copernicus.\n\nYou need to define your study region by right clicking on the map first, then use the search to search for ‘S2A’\nTry to find imagery from a day without too many clouds.\n\nObtain Landsat Legacy imagery for Islay from EarthExplorer\n\nYou can upload the shapefile of your study region in the first step for a precise search.\nTry browsing around to find the earliest image of Islay that you can.\n\nMerge and clip the imagery to the study region.\nMake two quick maps comparing the two sets of imagery, and export it for your portfolio.\n\n\n\nClimate data\nContemporary and (pre)historic climate data is now also readily available on a global scale. In particular, the so-called bioclimatic variables are a set of generic climate statistics widely used in ecological and archaeological modelling.\n\nObtain contemporary bioclimatic data from WorldClim.\nObtain palaeo-bioclimatic data from PaleoClim\n\nInclude all relevent layers for the Islay Mesolithic (13–7 ka)\n\nBack in QGIS, use the vector clip tool to clip these layers to the study region\nMake some quick maps of annual precipitation on Islay now and during the Mesolithic, and export them for your portfolio"

It supports arithmetic operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying, etc.), a limited set of mathematical functions (min, max, abs), boolean logic (AND, OR), and conditional logic (IF). These are the building blocks of many forms of raster analysis which, for ease of use, have their own dedicated tool in QGIS. But compared to these ‘out of the box’ tools, a great benefit of the raster calculator is its flexibility. Suppose, for example, we are interested investigating what effect sea level change and glacialisation would have had on site visibility on Islay. The raster calculator allows us to take an input (present-day) DEM and quickly build models of the past landscape using our own assumptions.\n\nIf it isn’t already, reproject (Raster → Projections → Warp (Reproject)...) nasadem_islay to a projected coordinate system\n\nRaster analysis tends to give inaccurate results with unprojected data, so from this point we will use the projected version of nasadem_islay for all analyses\nEPSG:27700 is an appropriate projected coordinate system for this region\nSelect ‘bilinear’ as the resampling method (this is usually a good choice for DEMs)\nQ: What is the difference between a projected and unprojected coordinate system?\n\nRasterize (Raster → Conversion) the islay_coastline layers for 13000BP and 7000BP (the beginning and end of the Islay Mesolithic).\n\nMake sure the rasters are in a projected CRS\nSet the extent and resolution of the rasters to match nasadem_islay\nThe resulting rasters should be coded as 0=sea and 1=land (you will need to unset ‘Nodata value’)\n\nRasterize the islay_coastline ice sheet layer for 13000 BP (as in step 2)\n\nLet’s assume the ice sheet had a uniform thickness of 500 m – set this as the ‘burn-in value’\n\nUse the raster calculator to generate two new DEMs for 7000 BP and 13000 BP that reflect sea level change.\n\nYou can do this by multiplying nasadem_islay (the projected version) by your sea rasters, e.g. \"nasadem_islay@1\" * \"sea7000bp@1\" (adjust the layer names accordingly).\nQ: Why are there now large ‘cliffs’ along the coastline? Is this a problem for viewshed analysis?\n\nUse the raster calculator to add the ice sheet to the 13000 BP.\n\nYou can do this by simply adding the nasadem_islay and ice sheet rasters.\n\n\nFinally, we should consider that today the island is mostly deforested, but in the Post-Glacial it was probably colonised by pine forest (Johnstone & Mykura 1989). We could make the assumption that lower-lying areas were cleared of trees, but perhaps higher elevations (where there are no known sites) were still covered with mature pine (≈36 m high).\n\nUse the raster calculator to create a new layer that models a tree-covered landscape in 7000 BP.\n\nYou can use an expression like this: if (\"dem7000bp@1\" > 80, \"dem7000bp@1\" + 36, dem7000bp@1\").\nQ: In your own words, what does the expression above do?\n\n\nInclude maps of your landscape models for 13000 BP, 7000 BP, and 7000 BP with trees, in your portfolio.\n\n\nLandform analysis\nQGIS comes with a variety of built-in tools to calculate more complex derivitives of an elevation model, comparing each cell of a raster to its neighbours in order to characterise the shape of the land. We won’t use these in the visibility analysis, but they’ll come in useful later when we look at predictive modelling. These include:\n\nAspect – which direction the terrain is facing\nSlope - how steep the terrain is\nRoughness, TRI & TPI – various measures of how uneven the terrain is\n\nThese are found under Raster → Analysis. For the most part these are ‘one-click’ tools, but some of the additional options can be tweaked.\n\nCalculate the aspect of nasadem_islay (projected, present-day).\nCalculate the slope of nasadem_islay (projected, present-day).\nCalculate the roughness of nasadem_islay (projected, present-day).\n\nIn your portfolio, include maps showing each of these derived rasters, and a short text (c. 250 words) described what they tell us about the island’s landscape.\n\n\n\nVisibility\nVisibility was the first widely-used application of GIS in archaeology and remains popular. This is probably because of its (apparent) simplicity: all you need is a set of site locations and a DEM. Unfortunately, this technical simplicity hides a great deal of practical and theoretical complexity (Wheatley & Gillings 2000) when applied to the way humans actually perceive landscapes. Nevertheless, it remains a useful tool.\n\nUsing the Viewshed tool in the Processing ToolBox, calculate a viewshed from a point of your choice on Islay.\n\nQ: What happens if you vary the observer height and target height? What do these mean?\n\n\nFor more complex visibility analysis than a single viewshed, we will need a plugin. Let’s take a look at intervisibility between multiple sites, for example.\n\nInstall “Visibility Analysis” plugin from the Plugin Manager.\n\nThis adds a new set of tools in the processing toolbox, under ‘visibility analysis’\n\nUse the create viewpoints tool to generate set of observation points representing Mesolithic sites on Islay.\n\nYou could do this using the Filter tool or the Select features by value… tool\nYou can leave all other options default (or feel free to adjust them)\n\nUsing the Viewshed tool from the plugin, generate the multiple viewshed of all sites in 7000 BP (without trees).\n\nAfter selecting your generated observation layer and DEM as input, you can leave all other options default.\nQ: What do darker and ligher areas on this map indicate?\n\nGenerate the intervisibility network between all sites at 7000 BP (without trees).\n\nAgain, there is no need to change the default options (but feel free to).\n\nRepeat steps 13–14 for two scenarios: a) 7000 BP with trees; and b) 13000 BP (with ice sheet).\n\nQ: Describe the differences between the scenarios (if any).\n\n\nInclude maps summarising intervisibility in all three scenarios (7000 BP without trees, 7000 BP with trees, 13000 BP) in your portfolio.\nThe cumulative viewshed is a way to look at visibility across an entire landscape: it calculates the visibility of every raster cell from every other raster cell, then adds them up.\n\nUse the visibility index tool to calculate the cumulative viewshed over Islay\n\nThis may take some time to process.\nQ: What do darker and lighter areas in a cumulative viewshed indicate?\n\n\nInclude a map with each cumulative viewshed in your portfolio."

Like most GIS and statistical software, QGIS does not work with a single file. It uses ‘projects’ (.qgz files or .qgs in older versions) to separate different working environments, which may incorporate many different files containing geospatial data, layer and style definitions, and output in various formats. QGIS does not impose a structure on these files: it is up to you to keep them organised.\nThere isn’t a single way to organise files. Above all, the most important thing is that your file structure is consistent and predictable – to you and to others.\n\nStart a new project in QGIS and save it in a new directory\n\nUnder Project → Properties, in the General tab, ensure that save paths is set to ‘relative’ (this is the default)\nQ: What is the difference between ‘relative’ and ‘absolute’ file paths?\n\nCreate a basic directory structure for your project. Bear in mind it will include:\n\nData files, project files, and output files (e.g. maps)\nBase map data\nData from different regions\nData in different file formats\nNB.: You don’t have to leave QGIS to do this. Look for the ‘Project Home’ node in the browser pane.\n\nCopy acheulean.csv to an appropriate place within your project and add it your map.\nSave your project, close QGIS, move or rename your project directory, then open it in QGIS again.\nChange save paths to ‘absolute’ and repeat the last step.\n\nQ: What happened?\n\nSet save paths back to the default, ‘relative’.\n\nQ: Why is it better to use relative paths?\n\n\nUse this project to organise all the data you will work with over the course of this practical. In your portfolio, include your finished file structure, after you have completed the rest of the practical.\n\n\nData sources\nThere are a lot of file formats that can be used as data sources within a GIS. From a GIS user’s point of view, we can group them into three categories: delimited text files, file- or directory-based formats, and database-based formats.\n\nDelimited text files\nPlain text files are the most common and portable way to store tabular data (‘spreadsheets’) in a scientific context. The are not a true geospatial format, because they do not contain information on the coordinate reference system, but they are widely used to distribute geospatial data, especially point geometries.\n\nCopy acheulean.csv, acheulean.tsv, acheulean.txt and acheulean_utm36s.csv to your project.\nAdd all four files to your map\n\nEnsure that they are all imported correctly, i.e. they should result in exactly the same points with exactly the same attributes being added to your map.\nQ: When might you prefer delimited text files over geospatial formats?\n\n\n\n\nFile/directory-based geospatial formats\nThe majority of commonly used formats fall into this category, where geospatial data (geometries, attributes, and CRS) is bundled together in either a single file, or a collection of files contained within a single directory. Adding any of these formats to a project in QGIS is generally straightforward, as is converting between them, so the choice is not so relevent in day-to-day work. However, it is important to consider which format is the best for long-term storage and exchange.\n\nFill in the table below for your portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat\nFile extension\nVector or raster?\nOpen format?\n\n\n\n\nShapefile\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoJSON\n\n\n\n\n\nKML\n\n\n\n\n\nAutocad DXF\n\n\n\n\n\nGeopackage\n\n\n\n\n\nFlatGeobuf\n\n\n\n\n\nGPX\n\n\n\n\n\nGeodatabase\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoTIFF\n\n\n\n\n\nASCII Grid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy fundstellen_bern.csv to your project and add it to your map.\nExport fundstellen_bern.csv to each of the formats below, copying the exported file to your project:\n\nESRI shapefile\nGeoPackage\nComma Seperated Value (CSV)\nQ: What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of these formats?\n\n\n\n\nDatabase-based geospatial formats\nWhen geospatial data gets more complex, it is common to incorporate them within a relational database system (RDMS). Some of the file-based formats above (e.g. GeoPackage, Geodatabase) are in fact databases saved as a file (or files). Most general-purpose database software (e.g. MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite) also have extensions for representing geospatial data – usually in the form of a special “geometry” column. The latter can be used to connect to data sources in a remote location. Otherwise, they work much like any other format.\n\n\n\nAttribute data\nApart from the geospatial data needed to put points (or lines, or polygons) on a map, geospatial formats usually come with “attributes”; that is, a table of data associated with the geometries. This is what we have been using for data-dependent symbologies, for example. QGIS has many features for selecting, filtering and manipulating these attributes.\n\nCopy c14_dates.csv to your project.\nConvert it to a suitable geospatial format, add this to your map, and remove the CSV.\nView the attribute table of the layer.\n\nQ: What data types are used in this attribute table?\n\nUsing select features by value, export dates from the ‘radon’ and ‘radonb’ databases as a new layer and add it to your project.\nUsing the filter tool, filter this layer to only show dates which fit the following conditions:\n\nHave an error (std) of less than 50\nAre from samples of charcoal, “collagen, bone” or “plant remains”\nAre from the Bronze Age\nQ: How many dates fit all these criteria?\n\nEdit the attribute table to correct the lab codes from ‘Rome-’. They should be ‘R-’.\nUsing the field calculator, update the ‘site_type’ field to use uppercase letters.\nUsing the field calculator, create a new column with the difference between the uncalibrated and calibrated ages.\n\nRemember to include your finished file structure from the first part of this practical in your portfolio."
